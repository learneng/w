    <h1>Practical Two: Interactive Map of India</h1>
    <p> What is an Image Map?
        Originally introduced in HTML 3.2 as a replacement for server side imagemaps. Server side image maps were clunky requiring a round trip to the web server to determine where to go based on the coordinates clicked in the image. Thus client side image-maps were born!
        
        An imagemap is a graphic image where a user can click on different parts of the image and be directed to different destinations. imagemaps are made by defining each of the hot areas in terms of their x and y coordinates (relative to the top left hand corner). With each set of coordinates, you specify a link that users will be directed to when they click within the area.
        
        As an example, say you have a map of India that you wish to act as an image map. Each Indian State could have their hot areas defined on the map to take you to different pages.</p>
        <p class="instruct">
            Click on any indian state from the map to open wiki about it!
